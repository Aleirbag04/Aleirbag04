  <h3>Hi there! 👋</h3>
    <p>I'm a full stack developer with a passion for creating pixel-perfect front end designs. I love to constantly learn and grow in my field and am always eager to take on new projects.</p>
    <p>When I'm not working on development or design, you can find me playing video games, spending time with my cats, or trying out new outdoor activities. I also have a degree in accounting, which has given me a unique perspective and set of skills that I bring to my work as a developer.</p>
    <p>Some fun facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I have three adorable cats that came with me all the way from Uruguay to Canada 🇺🇾🇨🇦</li>
      <li>I love playing board games and cooking up a storm in the kitchen 🎲👩‍🍳</li>
      <li>I am a self-professed coffee addict ☕️</li>
      <li>My boyfriend likes to call me an eternal student, and I have to admit, he's not wrong! 🤓</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:gfernandezchaves@gmail.com">gfernandezchaves@gmail.com</a> to chat about development or anything else!</p>
