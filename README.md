👩‍🎓 I am a Post Degree Diploma in Web and Mobile Development student at Langara College.

💥 I consider myself as a curious person that enjoys putting my creativity into every project that I face.

😎 When I’m not trying to learn and discover new things about development and design, I enjoy playing video games, chilling with my cats, or trying new outdoor activities.
